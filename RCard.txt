Model Card: RandomForestRegressor 
Model Details
•	Model Type: RandomForestRegressor (ensemble of decision trees)
•	Implementation: Python (scikit-learn)
•	Key Hyperparameters:
o	n_estimators = 100
o	max_depth = 10
o	random_state = 42
•	Interpretability Method: SHAP (used to evaluate feature importance and dependence)
Intended Use
•	Primary Purpose:
Predict monthly IWR and CWR for maize, rice, and wheat based on:
1.	CDI
2.	Temporal features (month, year)
•	Users/Stakeholders:
o	Agricultural researchers
o	Water resource managers and decision-makers
o	Policy analysts interested in irrigation planning under varying drought conditions
Data
•	Sources:
o	CWR and IWR Data: Three NetCDF files (maize, rice, wheat) covering 2000–2020
o	Drought Index (CDI): A NetCDF file (same 2000–2020 time range)
•	Data Processing:
o	Subsetting each dataset to a common 2000–2020 period
o	Resampling to monthly means
o	Removing invalid or placeholder values (e.g., 1e30 replaced with NaN)
o	Spatially averaging each variable over predefined basin coordinates
o	Merging time series (CWR/IWR and CDI) per basin, then adding month and year features
Model Training & Evaluation
•	Training/Validation Split: 80% training, 20% test, random split by time points in each basin’s dataset
•	Cross-Validation: 5-fold cross-validation on the training set to evaluate R²
•	Performance Metrics:
o	R² (coefficient of determination)
o	MSE (mean squared error)
•	SHAP Analysis:
o	Used to assess the importance and interaction of features (CDI, month, year) in predicting IWR
Results (Illustrative)
•	R² (CV): Varies by basin and crop, typically between 0.6–0.9 (example range)
•	R² (Test Set): Similar or slightly reduced compared to cross-validation scores
•	MSE: Depends on the absolute range of each basin’s CWR/IWR values
Limitations
1.	Data Dependence: Accuracy relies on the quality and representativeness of NetCDF CWR/ IWR and CDI data.
2.	Geographical Scope: Model is trained on specific basins; generalization to other regions/timeframes may be uncertain.
3.	Feature Set: Only three predictors (CDI, month, year). Including more environmental or management features might improve performance.
4.	Temporal Split: Random splitting by time might overlook sequential dependencies (e.g., year-to-year variations).
Ethical & Societal Considerations
•	Resource Allocation: Predictions can guide irrigation decisions affecting water resource allocation; results should be contextualized with local expertise.
•	Data Gaps: Regions with sparse data or atypical conditions might see reduced prediction accuracy.
Maintenance & Updates
•	Maintainer: Authors (1st authors)
•	Future Updates:
o	Integrate new data or longer time spans for improved accuracy
o	Re-tune model hyperparameters as more training data become available
•	Citation: Made available after publication acceptance 
o	Cite scikit-learn and original data sources (e.g., NetCDF datasets, any references for CDI) in any publications
